  </h1>
  <p class = "text-center px-5 mx-5 my-0 py-0">MEDLIFE’s mission is to help families achieve greater freedom from the constraints of poverty, empowering them to live healthier lives. Our patients did not choose to be poor, but they have chosen to strive toward a better life; MEDLIFE stands beside them in this pursuit.</p>
  <p class = "text-center px-5 mx-5 my-0 pb-0 pt-3">UF MEDLIFE represents a group of diverse individuals sharing a common goal. We work hard to bring awareness to the shortcomings many people experience. As student leaders we advocate for universal quality healthcare here in Gainesville and beyond.</p>
  <p class = "text-center px-5 mx-5 my-0 py-3 font-weight-bold">To this end, we commit our time, resources, knowledge and hope to bring Medicine, Education and Development to Low Income Families Everywhere.
